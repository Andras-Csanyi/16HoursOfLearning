Andras Csanyi, this is my name.

Who am I?

I consider myself a Librarian, where the meaning of librarian is a person who always seeks for knowledge. The other part
of this statement is that I have a library science master degree. I also have to add that I'm an army and border patrol
veteran, I have some knowledge in mechanical engineering field and communication science, my other master degree. I'm a
former QA engineer and engineering manager. I learned programming because an idea found me during my library studies,
and I want to create that system.

What I'm doing for living?

I'm a software developer at IBM where I'm member of the SDK Tooling team. C# is my main language, and I would say I'm
rather a backend dev than a full stack one. But not a problem to make my hands dirty on both sides. On daily basis I
work with Java, Python, Go and Node/JS.
