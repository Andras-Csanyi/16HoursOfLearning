# Array data structure

Array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified at least one
array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a
mathematical formula. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array.

The memory address of the first element of an array is called first address, foundation address, or base address.
