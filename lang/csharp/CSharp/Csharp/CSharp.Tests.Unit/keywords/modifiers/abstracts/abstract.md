### Abstract

The `abstract` modifier indicates that the thing being modified has a missing or incomplete
implementation. The abstract modifier can be used with classes, methods, properties, indexers,
and events.

Use the `abstract` modifier in a class declaration to indicate that a class is intended to be a
base class of other classes, not instantiated on its own.

Members marked as abstract must be implemented by non-abstract classes that derive from
abstract classes.
